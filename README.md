# Employee Management System (Java + MySQL)

## Overview
The Employee Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to handle basic employee-related operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details. The system integrates **Java Swing** for the front-end interface and **MySQL** for the back-end database, connected through **JDBC**.

This project demonstrates how a Java application can be connected to a database for real-time CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It follows an object-oriented approach for maintainable and reusable code.

## Features
- **Login System** – Secure authentication for users.
- **Add Employee** – Input employee details and store them in the database.
- **View Employee** – Display all employee records in a clean table format.
- **Update Employee** – Modify existing employee data.
